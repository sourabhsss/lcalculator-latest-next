          <AccordionContent>
            <p className="mb-2">
              A 10-key calculator is primarily used for numerical data entry and calculations in 
              accounting, bookkeeping, financial analysis, and other fields requiring rapid number processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Its specialized layout makes it particularly efficient for tasks including:

          <AccordionTrigger>How is a 10-key calculator different from a regular calculator?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p className="mb-2">
              A 10-key calculator differs from a regular calculator primarily in its layout and design focus:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Layout:</strong> The 10-key has numbers arranged in a compact 3Ã—3 grid with 0 below, 
              optimized for touch typing, whereas regular calculators often have numbers in a telephone-style layout.</li>
              <li><strong>Paper Tape:</strong> Many 10-key calculators include a paper tape or digital record of calculations.</li>
              <li><strong>Specialized Functions:</strong> 10-key calculators often include functions specific to accounting 
              like tax calculation, grand total, and item count.</li>
              <li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> They're designed for hours of continuous use with minimal hand movement.</li>
              <li><strong>Speed Focus:</strong> The design prioritizes rapid data entry over complex scientific functions.</li>

          <AccordionTrigger>What does "KPH" mean in 10-key proficiency?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p className="mb-2">
              "KPH" stands for "Keystrokes Per Hour" and is the standard measurement of 10-key proficiency.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              This metric counts how many keys a person can press in an hour while maintaining accuracy. In professional 
              settings, KPH is typically measured in combination with accuracy rates. For example, a requirement might be 
              "8,000 KPH with 98% accuracy."
            </p>
            <p>
              Proficiency levels generally range from:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
              <li>Beginner: 4,000-6,000 KPH</li>
              <li>Intermediate: 6,000-8,000 KPH</li>
              <li>Proficient: 8,000-10,000 KPH</li>
              <li>Expert: 10,000+ KPH</li>

          <AccordionTrigger>How can I improve my 10-key speed?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Improving your 10-key speed requires practice and proper technique:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Learn proper finger positioning:</strong> Use your middle finger on 5 (home position), 
                index finger for 4 and 1, ring finger for 6 and 3, and pinky for operation keys.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Practice "touch" operation:</strong> Train yourself to use the keypad without looking 
                at it, similar to touch typing on a keyboard.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use rhythm:</strong> Develop a consistent rhythm when entering numbers to build muscle memory.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Practice regularly:</strong> Dedicate 15-20 minutes daily to 10-key drills.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Focus on accuracy first:</strong> Speed will naturally improve as you gain accuracy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use proper drills:</strong> Practice with structured exercises like forward/reverse sequences 
                and repeated patterns.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Time yourself:</strong> Track your KPH and set incremental goals for improvement.
