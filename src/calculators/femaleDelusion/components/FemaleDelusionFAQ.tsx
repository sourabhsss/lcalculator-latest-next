      question: 'What is "female delusion" in the context of relationships?',
      answer: 'In relationship psychology, "female delusion" refers to unrealistic expectations women might hold about dating, partnerships, or their own desirability in the dating market. These can include overestimating available options while setting unrealistically high standards for potential partners, expecting traditional benefits without traditional contributions, or misunderstanding statistical realities of the dating landscape. This calculator addresses these potential misalignments by highlighting areas where expectations may not match reality.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How is the delusion score calculated?',
      answer: 'The delusion score is calculated based on your responses to various questions about dating expectations, standards, and self-awareness. The algorithm considers factors like the gap between your standards for others versus personal effort, age preferences, financial expectations, and other relationship beliefs. Some factors are weighted more heavily than others based on psychological research about relationship success predictors. The scoring system is designed to identify potential misalignments between expectations and reality, not to make judgments about an individual\'s worth or value.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is this calculator only for women?',
      answer: 'While the calculator\'s name references "female delusion," anyone can use it for self-reflection regardless of gender. The questions address universal relationship dynamics and expectation management issues. The psychological principles of reciprocity, realistic expectations, and self-awareness apply to everyone in the dating landscape. Women, men, and non-binary individuals can all benefit from examining whether their relationship expectations align with reality and what they themselves bring to potential partnerships.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Does a high score mean I can\'t find a relationship?',
      answer: 'Not at all. A high delusion score doesn\'t mean you can\'t find a relationship—it simply suggests there may be a significant gap between your current expectations and realistic outcomes. This awareness is actually the first step toward improvement. By identifying specific areas where your expectations might be misaligned with reality, you can make targeted adjustments that could substantially improve your relationship prospects. Many women with initially high scores have successfully formed fulfilling relationships after recalibrating their approach to dating and partnerships.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I improve my score?',
      answer: 'Improving your score involves working on aligning your expectations with reality. This might include: (1) Honestly assessing what you bring to relationships across different dimensions, (2) Developing a more realistic understanding of statistical realities in dating, (3) Focusing on core compatibility factors rather than superficial criteria, (4) Building skills that make you a better partner, like emotional intelligence and communication abilities, (5) Expanding your social circles to meet diverse potential partners, and (6) Working with a therapist or relationship coach if you notice persistent patterns of disappointment in your dating life.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there scientific research behind this calculator?',
      answer: 'This calculator is informed by research from relationship psychology, evolutionary psychology, and sociology. Studies on relationship formation, satisfaction, and longevity have identified key factors that contribute to successful partnerships. While the specific scoring algorithm is simplified for accessibility, the underlying principles reflect empirical findings about expectation management, reciprocity, and compatibility factors. However, it\'s important to remember that this is an educational tool for self-reflection, not a clinical or diagnostic instrument validated through formal scientific studies.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can unrealistic expectations really impact dating success?',
      answer: 'Yes, considerable research supports this connection. Studies published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships found that women with unrealistic relationship expectations reported significantly lower relationship satisfaction and higher rates of relationship failure. Unrealistic expectations create a perpetual gap between desires and reality, leading to chronic disappointment. They can also cause individuals to overlook compatible partners who don\'t meet arbitrary criteria, while pursuing matches with whom they have little chance of forming lasting connections. Psychologists consider expectation management one of the most important factors in relationship satisfaction.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Why do some women have unrealistic dating expectations?',
      answer: 'Several factors contribute to unrealistic expectations: (1) Media representations of relationships that emphasize idealized romantic narratives, (2) Social media creating distorted impressions of others\' appearances and lifestyles, (3) Dating apps promoting an illusion of endless options for women who receive many matches, (4) Cultural messages that encourage seeking "perfect" matches rather than building compatible partnerships, (5) Cognitive biases like the fundamental attribution error that lead us to overvalue our own positive qualities while being critical of others, and (6) Lack of realistic feedback from social circles that increasingly avoid honest but uncomfortable conversations.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does reciprocity affect relationship success?',
      answer: 'Reciprocity—the balanced exchange of effort, value, and investment—is fundamental to relationship success. Research from the Gottman Institute shows that perceived fairness in contribution strongly predicts relationship satisfaction and longevity. Relationships where one partner consistently expects qualities they don\'t reciprocate typically show high instability and dissatisfaction. This doesn\'t mean partners need to be identical in all aspects, but rather that the overall value exchange should feel equitable to both parties. Understanding reciprocity helps individuals develop expectations that align with what they themselves contribute to relationships.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I just lower my standards to improve my score?',
      answer: 'The goal isn\'t to lower standards but to align them with reality and ensure reciprocity. There\'s an important distinction between compromise (adjusting non-essential preferences) and settling (accepting relationships that don\'t meet your core needs). The focus should be on identifying which standards are genuinely important for relationship compatibility versus those based on social validation or unrealistic media portrayals. Research shows that successful long-term couples prioritize character qualities, shared values, and genuine connection over superficial or status-based criteria. Realistic standards actually lead to more fulfilling relationships than either unrealistically high or harmfully low ones.'
