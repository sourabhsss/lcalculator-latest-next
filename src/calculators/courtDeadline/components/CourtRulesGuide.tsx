                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Jurisdictional deadlines are imposed by statute and affect the court's ability to hear a case.</p>
                <p><strong>Cannot Be Extended:</strong> These deadlines typically cannot be extended, even by agreement of the parties or court order.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Statutes of limitations, notice requirements for government claims, and deadlines for appeals are often jurisdictional.</p>
                <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Missing a jurisdictional deadline often results in the permanent loss of the right to pursue a claim or defense.</p>
