              What's the difference between AP Lang and AP Lit?

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                AP English Language and Composition (AP Lang) focuses on rhetoric, argumentative writing, and 
                analysis of non-fiction texts. It emphasizes persuasive writing and understanding how authors 
                construct arguments.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">
                AP English Literature and Composition (AP Lit) centers on literary analysis of fiction, poetry, 
                and drama. It emphasizes critical reading, literary techniques, and analysis of themes and characters 
                in literary works.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">
                While both courses develop critical reading and writing skills, AP Lang is more practical and 
                focused on argumentation, while AP Lit is more focused on literary interpretation.

              Is AP Lang harder than AP Lit?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                Neither course is inherently "harder" than the other; they simply focus on different skills 
                and types of texts. Some students find AP Lang more accessible because it deals with non-fiction 
                texts and practical argumentation. Others prefer AP Lit because they enjoy analyzing literature.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">
                Looking at score distributions, AP Lang typically has slightly higher pass rates (scores of 3+) 
                than AP Lit, but this doesn't necessarily mean it's easierâ€”it could reflect student preparation, 
                interest, or other factors.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">
                The best choice depends on your personal strengths and interests. Many students take both courses, 
                often AP Lang in junior year and AP Lit in senior year.

              What score do I need to get college credit?

            <AccordionContent>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                College credit policies vary by institution. Most selective colleges require a score of 4 or 5 
                to grant credit, while some may accept a 3. Some highly selective institutions (like Ivy League 
                schools) may not offer credit for AP scores at all but may use them for placement purposes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">
                Here are some examples of AP Lang credit policies:

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-1 space-y-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                <li>University of California system: Score of 3, 4, or 5 earns credit</li>
                <li>University of Michigan: Score of 4 or 5 earns credit</li>
                <li>Ohio State University: Score of 3, 4, or 5 earns credit</li>
                <li>Boston University: Score of 4 or 5 earns credit</li>
                <li>Georgetown University: No credit, but scores may be used for placement</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">
                Always check the specific policies at your target colleges, as they can change and vary widely.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                This calculator provides an estimate based on typical scoring patterns, but it's important to 
                understand some limitations:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-1 space-y-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                <li>The College Board does not publish the exact conversion formulas they use each year</li>
                <li>Scoring scales can vary slightly from year to year based on exam difficulty</li>
                <li>Essay scores in this calculator are self-reported estimates and may differ from how AP readers would score your actual essays</li>
                <li>The calculator uses approximations of the weighting between multiple-choice and free-response sections</li>

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">
                For the most accurate assessment, take official practice tests and have your essays evaluated 
                by an AP Lang teacher familiar with the scoring rubrics. This calculator should be used as a 
                general guide rather than a definitive prediction.
