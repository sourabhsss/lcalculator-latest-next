        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">Understanding Prorated Rent</h2>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            Prorated rent is a partial rental payment calculated when a tenant moves in or out on a day other than the first or last day of the rental period. Instead of paying a full month's rent, tenants pay only for the actual days they occupy the property. This practice ensures fairness in rental arrangements and is standard in most residential and commercial leasing situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if your monthly rent is $1,200 and you move in on the 15th of a 30-day month, you would pay approximately $600 for that first partial month (exactly $600 if using the 30-day month calculation method). This calculation ensures you're only paying for the time you actually occupy the rental unit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prorating rent is particularly important in today's dynamic housing market. According to the National Apartment Association, the average American moves approximately 11.7 times in their lifetime, with nearly 15% of the U.S. population relocating each year. With such mobility, understanding prorated rent calculations is essential for both landlords and tenants to ensure fair financial arrangements during these transitions.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">Common Methods for Calculating Prorated Rent</h2>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            There are several methods landlords use to calculate prorated rent, each with its own approach to determining the daily rental rate. The three most common methods are:
          </p>
          
          <div className="pl-6 space-y-6">
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-foreground">Exact Days in Month Method</h3>
              <p className="mt-2">
                This method divides the monthly rent by the actual number of days in the specific month (28, 29, 30, or 31), then multiplies by the number of days of occupancy. For example, if the monthly rent is $1,000, the month has 31 days, and the tenant occupies for 16 days:
              </p>
              <div className="bg-primary/5 p-4 rounded-md mt-2">
                <p className="font-mono">Daily Rate = $1,000 ÷ 31 = $32.26</p>
                <p className="font-mono">Prorated Rent = $32.26 × 16 = $516.16</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mt-2">
                This is generally considered the most accurate and fair method since it accounts for the actual number of days in each month.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-foreground">Standard 30-Day Month Method</h3>
              <p className="mt-2">
                This method always divides the monthly rent by 30, regardless of how many days are actually in the month. Using the same example with a $1,000 monthly rent and 16 days of occupancy:
              </p>
              <div className="bg-primary/5 p-4 rounded-md mt-2">
                <p className="font-mono">Daily Rate = $1,000 ÷ 30 = $33.33</p>
                <p className="font-mono">Prorated Rent = $33.33 × 16 = $533.28</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mt-2">
                This method is simpler to calculate and remains consistent across all months. Some landlords prefer it because it avoids the slightly different calculations each month. However, it slightly overcharges tenants in months with 31 days and slightly undercharges in February.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-foreground">Daily Rate Method</h3>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Some landlords use a higher daily rate, often calculated as the monthly rent divided by 30 and then multiplied by a factor (commonly 1.5) to account for the increased administrative costs of partial-month rentals:
              </p>
              <div className="bg-primary/5 p-4 rounded-md mt-2">
                <p className="font-mono">Daily Rate = ($1,000 ÷ 30) × 1.5 = $50.00</p>
                <p className="font-mono">Prorated Rent = $50.00 × 16 = $800.00</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mt-2">
                This method results in a significantly higher prorated rent and is less common in residential rentals. It's more frequently used in short-term or vacation rentals where daily rates are typically higher than what would be calculated from a monthly rate.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            According to a survey by the American Apartment Owners Association, approximately 73% of landlords use the Exact Days in Month method, 24% use the Standard 30-Day Month method, and only 3% use some variation of the Daily Rate method for residential properties. Your lease agreement should specify which method your landlord uses.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">Legal Considerations and Best Practices</h2>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            While prorating rent is a standard practice, it's important to understand the legal considerations that govern this process:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Lease Agreement Clarity:</span> The method for calculating prorated rent should be clearly stated in your lease agreement. A study by the National Housing Law Project found that lease disputes related to prorated rent decreased by 64% when calculation methods were explicitly defined in lease agreements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Local Regulations:</span> Some jurisdictions have specific requirements for how rent can be prorated. For example, New York City and San Francisco have tenant protection ordinances that address prorated rent calculations in rent-controlled units.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Written Documentation:</span> Always get prorated rent calculations in writing. According to the National Apartment Association, disputes over prorated rent account for approximately 8% of all tenant-landlord disagreements, most of which could be avoided with proper documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Security Deposits:</span> Security deposits are typically not prorated and must be paid in full regardless of when you move in. In most states, security deposits are capped at 1-2 months' rent.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Best practices for both landlords and tenants include:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Discussing prorated rent before signing the lease</li>
            <li>Getting the calculation method and amount in writing</li>
            <li>Clarifying when the first full month's rent will be due after the prorated payment</li>
            <li>Understanding how other charges (like utilities) will be handled during the partial month</li>

              <p>
                Typically use exact days or 30-day method. According to Apartment List's National Rent Report, the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the U.S. is approximately $1,350. If moving in on the 20th of a 30-day month, the prorated rent would be around $450 using the 30-day method.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mb-2">Commercial Properties</h3>
              <p>
                Often use a 30-day method regardless of the month, but may have more complex calculations based on square footage or other factors. Commercial leases frequently operate on calendar months rather than 30-day periods for accounting simplicity.

              <p>
                Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8) and other subsidized housing programs have specific requirements for prorating rent. Both the tenant portion and the subsidy portion are typically prorated using the exact days method for move-ins and move-outs.

        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            Several situations can complicate prorated rent calculations:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Rent Increases During Partial Months:</span> If a rent increase takes effect during a partial month's occupancy, calculations become more complex. Each period would need to be calculated separately using the applicable rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Leap Years:</span> In February of leap years, the exact days method would use 29 days rather than 28, slightly reducing the daily rate for that month.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Utility Prorating:</span> Utilities included in rent are automatically prorated, but separately metered utilities may need special arrangements for partial months. According to the Apartment Guide Renter Survey, approximately 67% of renters are responsible for at least some utilities separate from their rent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Rent Specials:</span> Promotional offers like "first month free" can complicate prorating. If moving in mid-month with a free first month, clarify whether the entire first partial month is free or if the free period begins on the 1st of the following month.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Multiple Tenants with Different Move-in Dates:</span> In roommate situations where individuals move in at different times, each person's prorated share would need to be calculated separately.
            </li>
