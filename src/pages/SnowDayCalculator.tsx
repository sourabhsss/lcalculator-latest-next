      question: "How accurate are snow day predictions?",
      answer: "Snow day predictions are based on multiple factors including weather forecasts, historical data, and local conditions. According to the National Weather Service, winter weather forecasts are about 90% accurate within 24 hours. However, school closure decisions involve many variables beyond weather, including district policies, road conditions, and facility readiness. Our calculator combines weather data with historical closure patterns to provide an educated estimate."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors influence school snow day decisions?",
      answer: "School administrators consider multiple factors when deciding on snow days. Primary factors include snowfall amount (typically 6+ inches raises closure probability significantly), temperature (below 15°F increases chances), wind speed (over 35 mph is concerning), road conditions, and timing of the storm. A study by the Education Research Alliance found that 75% of snow days occur when snowfall exceeds 6 inches, and 90% occur when temperatures drop below 15°F combined with any snow accumulation."
    },
    {
      question: "How do different regions handle snow days differently?",
      answer: "Regional differences significantly impact snow day decisions. Northern states typically require more snow (6-8 inches) for closure compared to southern states (2-4 inches). According to the Department of Education, schools in the Northeast average 4.2 snow days per year, while Southern schools average 0.4 days. This is partly due to varying infrastructure and experience in handling winter weather."
    },
    {
      question: "Do virtual learning options affect snow day policies?",
      answer: "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools have adapted their snow day policies. A 2022 Rand Corporation study found that 61% of districts now consider remote learning as an alternative to traditional snow days. However, about 84% of schools still maintain some traditional snow days to preserve the cultural tradition and account for potential power outages."
    },
    {
      question: "How do snow days impact the school calendar?",
      answer: "Most U.S. schools build 2-3 snow days into their academic calendars. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that 89% of schools exceed their allocated snow days at least once every five years. When this happens, 73% extend the school year, 15% convert holidays to school days, and 12% extend school days to make up the time."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the economic impact of snow days?",
      answer: "Snow days have significant economic implications. A 2015 IZA Institute study estimated that each snow day costs a regional economy about $100-150 per student in lost economic activity, considering parent workplace disruption and school operational costs. However, safety concerns outweigh economic factors in decision-making."

          <h2>Understanding Snow Day Predictions in 2024</h2>
          <p>
            Snow days remain a cherished part of the American school experience, with over 50 million students potentially affected each winter. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. schools average 2.5 snow days per year, though this varies significantly by region and local factors.

                <p className="text-sm">
                  Studies show that temperatures below 15°F increase snow day probability by 40%, especially when combined with any snowfall. Wind chill factors below 0°F often trigger automatic closure protocols in many districts.

                <p className="text-sm">
                  Sustained winds over 35 mph can lead to dangerous wind chill conditions and visibility issues. The National Weather Service reports that blowing snow reduces visibility to less than ¼ mile in 78% of winter storm events.

          <h3>Regional Differences in Snow Day Decisions</h3>
          <p>
            Snow day policies vary significantly by region, reflecting different levels of winter weather preparedness and infrastructure. Here's how different regions typically handle winter weather:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Northeast (4.2 average snow days/year):</strong> Well-equipped for snow removal, typically requires 6+ inches for closure</li>
            <li><strong>Midwest (3.8 days/year):</strong> Focuses on wind chill factors and road conditions</li>
            <li><strong>South (0.4 days/year):</strong> More likely to close with minimal snow (2-3 inches)</li>
            <li><strong>West (2.1 days/year):</strong> Varies widely by elevation and urban vs. rural location</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Future of Snow Days</h3>
          <p>
            The concept of snow days is evolving with technology and climate change. Recent studies show:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>61% of districts now have virtual learning options for snow days</li>
            <li>Climate change has reduced average annual snow days by 23% since 1970</li>
            <li>90% of parents support maintaining traditional snow days despite virtual options</li>
            <li>Schools are developing hybrid policies that balance safety, education, and tradition</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Making the Most of Snow Day Predictions</h3>
